    <p>One November night in the year 1782, so the story runs, two brothers sat over their winter fire in the little
      French town of Annonay, watching the grey smoke-wreaths from the hearth curl up the wide chimney. Their names were
      Stephen and Joseph Montgolfier, they were papermakers by trade, and were noted as possessing thoughtful minds and
      a deep interest in all scientific knowledge and new discovery.</p>
    <p>Before that night—a memorable night, as it was to prove—hundreds of millions of people had watched the rising
      smoke-wreaths of their fires without drawing any special inspiration from the fact.”</p>
